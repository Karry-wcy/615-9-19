## Introduction

The `HairEyeColor` dataset from the R datasets package is a three-way contingency table.  
It records the frequencies of combinations of **Hair color**, **Eye color**, and **Sex**.  
This dataset is useful for exploring categorical distributions and group comparisons.



## Visualization

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
df <- as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)

ggplot(df, aes(x = Hair, y = Freq, fill = Eye)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ Sex) +
  labs(
    title = "Hair Color × Eye Color × Sex",
    x = "Hair Color", y = "Frequency", fill = "Eye Color"
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12)
```

## Interpretation

The plot shows the joint distribution of hair and eye color, separated by sex.  
Overall, **Brown hair with Brown or Blue eyes** is most frequent.  
Males and females display broadly similar patterns, though slight differences exist.  
This visualization highlights how categorical variables can be compared across groups.
